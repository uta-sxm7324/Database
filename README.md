# A Simple Database Webserver

To get started, run the following commands:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

## Prerequisites

The server assumes that you

1) Have a MySQL (ex. XAMPP) server running on port 3306
2) The MySQL server is configured with a user ``server``
- This user has no password
- This user has sufficient permissions 
- This user can connect from any host

## Using the Web Server

Connect to the webserver locally via ``http://localhost:8100``

There are many different canned queries which can be executed from there
